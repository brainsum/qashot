## Prerequirements

### Base

- PHP 7.0 or newer
- composer ([https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
- drush ([http://docs.drush.org/en/8.x/install-alternative/](http://docs.drush.org/en/8.x/install-alternative/))
- npm ([https://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs](https://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs), [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

Then continue the traditionally installation with: [Linux/Mac guide](#install-qashot-on-linuxmac) and/or [Windows Guide](#install-qashot-on-windows)

### When using docker

- PHP 7.0 or newer
- composer ([https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/))
- docker ([https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/))
    - This guide assumes you installed it so it doesn't need sudo to run
- docker-compose ([https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

Continue with: [Linux/Mac guide with docker](#install-qashot-on-linuxmac-with-docker)

### Optional

- You will need **any** site locally with two copies of it, make sure, it's editable (by admin) and has a public page (viewable by anonymous user). This will be used to test QAShot, if the internet connection is slow/dead.
- If you prefer SlimerJS over PhantomJS or you want to have both of them you will need Firefox version 45 (current slimerjs supports firefox up to the version 52) has and XVFB also installed.
    - `sudo apt-get install firefox=45.\*`
    - `sudo apt-get install xvfb`

## Install QAShot on Linux/Mac

### Install drupal

1. Clone the repo to your favorite place:  
`git clone https://github.com/brainsum/qashot qashot`
2. Enter the directory: `cd qashot`
3. Get drupal and module files  
`composer install`
4. Import this site to your favorite apache+php config (i.e. XAMPP, Acquia Dev Desktop)  
**NOTE: at least PHP 7.0 required!**  
Webroot: `<git-root>/web`  
Create also a virtual host for it if your program didn't do that. (like: `qashot.localhost` or `qashot.lh` or `qashot.dd`)  
After you finished: `cd web`
5. Install site:  
`drush si --site-name=QAShot --site-mail=qashot@test.com --account-name=admin --account-pass=123 --db-url=mysql://username:password@localhost/qashot standard`  
**NOTE**: don't forget to change the DB's user, password etc. in this command if needed! 
6. Modify settings.php (add these lines):
    1. `$config\_directories['sync'] = '../config/prod';`
    2. `$settings['file\_private\_path'] = '../private\_files';`
    3. `$settings['file\_public\_path'] = 'sites/default/files';`
7. Rewrite some stuff and import configs:
    1. `drush ev '\Drupal::entityManager()->getStorage("shortcut\_set")->load("default")->delete();'`
    2. `drush config-set  "system.site" uuid "f700763e-1289-406f-919e-98dc38728a53" -y`
    3. `drush cim -y`
    4. `drush cr`

### Install screenshot maker

Install at least one of the following (globally):

1. BackstopJS ([https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS)) (`npm install -g backstopjs`)
2. SlimerJS ([https://slimerjs.org/download.html](https://slimerjs.org/download.html))  
This will need firefox, too: `sudo apt-get install firefox=45.\*`  
As well as xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`

Check your installation, if your chosen one is able to run from anywhere, you are done, if not, you need to add your bin location to PATH variables, which probably need a system restart.

`backstop --version` or `slimerjs`

## Install QAShot on Linux/Mac with docker

**NOTE**: if your host PC doesn't have PHP7, than you need to run composer commands inside the docker!

### Install drupal

1. Clone repo to your favorite place:  
`git clone https://github.com/brainsum/qashot qashot`
2. Enter the directory: `cd qashot`
3. Get drupal and module files  
`composer install`
4. Set correct access and rights (you don't need this on Windows):
    1. `sudo chgrp 33 . -R`
    2. `sudo chown 33 private\_files web/sites/default/files -R`  
Note: 33 is the UID and GID of the www-data user inside the docker container. If your host has this user with the same IDs, then you can replace the numbers with  www-data.
5. Start the docker container  
`docker-compose up -d`
6. Enter to docker container  
`docker-compose exec --user 33 php bash`
7. Install site:  
`cd web`  
`drush si --site-name=QAShot --site-mail=qashot@test.com --account-name=admin --account-pass=123 --db-url=mysql://drupal:drupal@mariadb/drupal standard`  
**NOTE**: don't forget to change the DB's user, password etc. in this command if needed! 
8. Modify settings.php (add these lines):
    1. `$config\_directories['sync'] = '../config/prod';`
    2. `$settings['file\_private\_path'] = '../private\_files';`
    3. `$settings['file\_public\_path'] = 'sites/default/files';`
9. Rewrite some stuff and import configs:
    1. `drush ev '\Drupal::entityManager()->getStorage("shortcut\_set")->load("default")->delete();'`
    2. `drush config-set  "system.site" uuid "f700763e-1289-406f-919e-98dc38728a53" -y`
    3. `drush cim -y`
    4. `drush cr`
10. Exit from docker console:  
`Ctrl + d` or type `exit`
11. Visit your site at: [http://localhost:](http://localhost:8000/) [8000](http://localhost:8000/) , log in with user: admin , password: 123
12. Create a test, add it to the queue
13. Run the queue (exit the container and cd ../ from your qashot folder): `bash qashot/run-test-queue.sh`  
OR from inside the container:  
`cd web`  
`drush php-script modules/custom/qa\_shot/tools/RunQAShotQueues`

### Install screenshot maker

Install at least one of the following (globally) on your system:

1. BackstopJS ([https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS)) (`npm install -g backstopjs`)
2. SlimerJS ([https://slimerjs.org/download.html](https://slimerjs.org/download.html))  
This will need firefox, too: `sudo apt-get install firefox=45.\*`  
As well as xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`

Check your installation, if your chosen one is able to run from anywhere, you are done, if not, you need to add your bin location to PATH variables, which probably need a system restart.

`backstop --version` or `slimerjs`

## Install QAShot on Windows

I recommend: Windows 10 with Bash on Linux on Windows + Acquia Dev Desktop/XAMPP

If you use Bash + XAMPP, drupal site install same as the Linux case.

If you use Bash + Acquia Dev Desktop, run composer from Bash, and drush from ADD (if ADD's composer doesn't work).  
Note: ADD has composer, butâ€¦ sometimes it's not really want to work (at least for me, it never worked)

When you **install npm** , install **WINDOWS version**! Because XAMPP and ADD will run cmd not bash.

### Install drupal

1. Clone repo to your favorite place:  
`git clone https://github.com/brainsum/qashot qashot`
2. Enter the directory: `cd qashot`
3. Get drupal and module files  
`composer install`
4. Import this site to your favorite apache+php config (i.e. XAMPP, Acquia Dev Desktop)  
**NOTE: at least PHP 7.0 required!**  
Webroot: `<git-root>/web`  
Create also a virtual host for it if your program didn't do that. (like: `qashot.localhost` or `qashot.lh` or `qashot.dd`)  
After you finished: `cd web`
5. Install site:  
`drush si --site-name=QAShot --site-mail=qashot@test.com --account-name=admin --account-pass=123 --db-url=mysql://username:password@localhost/qashot standard`  
**NOTE**: don't forget to change the DB's user, password etc. in this command if needed! 
6. Modify settings.php (add these lines):
    1. `$config\_directories['sync'] = '../config/prod';`
    2. `$settings['file\_private\_path'] = '../private\_files';`
    3. `$settings['file\_public\_path'] = 'sites/default/files';`
7. Rewrite some stuff and import configs:
    1. Choose one of these:
        1. From **bash** :
`drush ev '\Drupal::entityManager()->getStorage("shortcut\_set")->load("default")->delete();'`
        2. From **cmd** :
`drush ev "\Drupal::entityManager()->getStorage(\"shortcut\_set\")->load(\"default\")->delete();"`
    2. `drush config-set  "system.site" uuid "f700763e-1289-406f-919e-98dc38728a53" -y`
    3. `drush cim -y sync`
    4. `drush cr`

### Install screenshot maker

After you installed **Windows verison** from **npm** , Install at least one of the following (globally) from **cmd** :

1. BackstopJS ([https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS)) (`npm install -g backstopjs`)
2. SlimerJS ([https://slimerjs.org/download.html](https://slimerjs.org/download.html))  
This will need firefox, too: `sudo apt-get install firefox=45.\*`  
As well as xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`

Check your installation, if your chosen one is able to run from anywhere, you are done, if not, you need to add your bin location to PATH variables, which probably need a system restart.

`backstop --version` or `slimerjs`

## Possible problems

After installation, my site is broken into small pieces! (Windows)

Well, this happens when you don't have a properly setted temp directory. Go to /admin/config/media/file-system and watch what is there. Probably it will "/tmp". In windows it will be on your html directory's drive's root if you use ADD. Soo, if your web html is here and named phptest: E:\phptest than /tmp dir will be at: E:\tmp . Give 777 for it and cache rebuild, then you will be able to rock. This happens only once, if you didn't used this previously.

"Filename directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect" error at drush run (Windows, ADD)

Long story in short, your global drush and local drush conflicts. Delete drush\* files from <gitroot>/vendor/bin . Than you will be able to run drush.

## Required settings.php overrides

* For sending data to the remove worker:

```
$config['qashot.settings']['current_environment'] = 'development';
if (isset($_ENV['PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT']) && \is_string($_ENV['PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT'])) {
  $config['qashot.settings']['current_environment'] = $_ENV['PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT'];
}
```
```
$config['backstopjs.settings']['suite']['remote_host'] = '<the host>';
```

* For getting data from the remote queue:
```
$config['rabbitmq.settings'] = [
  'connection' => [
    'host' => '<the host>',
    'port' => <port>,
    'user' => 'user',
    'pass' => 'pass',
    'vhost' => '/',
    'timeout' => 30,
    'heartbeat' => 60,
  ],
  'channels' => [
    'channel_name' => [
      'exchange' => 'exchange name',
      'queue' => 'queue name',
      'routing_key' => 'routing_key',
      'prefetch' => 'prefetch count',
    ],
    ...
  ],
];
```
